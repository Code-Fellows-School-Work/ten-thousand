Any subsequent prompts that you ask for changes.

### Prompt 1
write me code for this game:
- Handle calculating score for dice roll
- Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
- The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
- The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the roll’s score according to rules of game.

### Prompt 3
write me a function for this:
- Handle rolling dice
- Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.
- The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.
- The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
- The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.

</code>
</pre>

### Prompt 4
input into the game logic this scoring method for the game:
- Single fives are worth 50 points
- Single ones are worth 100 points
- Three of a kind are worth 100 points times the number rolled, except for three ones which are worth 1000 points
- If four, five, or six of a kind are rolled, each additional dice doubles the amount of dice previously rolled. For example, 4 dice showing the number 3 would be 600 points and 5 dice showing the number 3 would be 1200 points
- This makes the highest possible score in a single roll 8000 for six ones (1000 for three ones, after that player multiplies the roll by two for each additional one in that series of rolling.)
- A straight from 1 to 6 is worth 1500 points. If a player fails to roll a straight, they may make one attempt to complete the straight. If the desired number(s) does not turn up on the next roll, that round is a "crap out" even if there are scoring dice on the table i.e. 1's or 5's.
- Three pairs are worth 1000 points, for instance 2+2, 4+4, 5+5. This rule does not count if you roll a quadruple and a pair e.g. 2+2, 2+2, 6+6 unless stated otherwise (some places have their own house rules).
- Full house (3 of a kind plus 2 of a kind) are worth 1,500

### Prompt 5
adjust that code to use this scoring method instead:
- zilch - roll with no scoring dice should return 0
- ones - rolls with various number of 1s should return correct score
- twos - rolls with various number of 2s should return correct score
- threes - rolls with various number of 3s should return correct score
- fours - rolls with various number of 4s should return correct score
- fives - rolls with various number of 5s should return correct score
- sixes - rolls with various number of 6s should return correct score
- straight - 1,2,3,4,5,6 should return correct score
- three_pairs - 3 pairs should return correct score
- two_trios - 2 sets of 3 should return correct score
- leftover_ones - 1s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score
- leftover_fives - 5s not used in set of 3 (or greater) should return correct score
